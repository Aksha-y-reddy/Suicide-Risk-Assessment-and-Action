# Suicide Risk Assessment and Action


Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create a conversation system capable of identifying persons who are at high risk of self-harm. The objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of properly detecting suicide risk in conversations, allowing us to give immediate attention and assistance.

Target Population

Our target audience consists of people who communicate through various channels such as chatbots, hotlines, or other kinds of digital communication. We will work on creating a system that can recognize risks in these encounters and initiate relevant responses.

Goals

Identify individuals or conversations that indicate an elevated risk of self-harm.
Develop follow-up questions to help refine our understanding of the individual's risk level.
Create an assessment and action protocol based on the identified risks.
